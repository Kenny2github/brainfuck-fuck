Just a nice little brainfuck interpreter in Python.

The cheaty bit: you can use = to assign that cell to a certain number
e.g. =A sets that cell to the number 65, and =a sets it to 97
This simplifies a "Hello World!" program from six lines of 30 columns to one line:
=H.=e.=l.=l.=o.= .=W.=o.=r.=l.=d.=!.
This can't copy values, though, so it's only good for constants.
