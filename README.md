# brainfuck-fuck
Just a nice little brainfuck interpreter in Python.

Nope! This is brainfuck-*fuck*. You know there's C, then C+, then C++? Well, there's brainfuck, and now there's brainfuck-fuck.
Brainfuck-fuck is supposedly backwards compatible. So therefore this:
```brainfuck
+++++++ [ > ++++++++++ < - ] > ++ . [-]<[-] ++++++++++ [ > ++++++++++ < - ] > +++++ .
```
does exactly the same thing as this:
```brainfuck
=H.=i.
```
besides the fact that the first one uses two cells while the second uses one.

A full list of additions:
* The `=` command. This sets the current cell's value to the ASCII value of the character after the `=`. Therefore `=H` sets the cell to 72 (the ASCII value of H).
* An if/else statement! The syntax is `? (code) : (code) !`. When a `?` is reached, it checks the current cell. If the current cell is 0, it skips to the corresponding `:`. Otherwise, it continues on until the `:`, then skips to the `!`. Thus `+ ? =Y : =N ! .` prints out "Y" while `? =Y : =N ! .` prints out "N".
* Functions! To define a function, use `(@ symbol)(single ASCII character)(code)(pipe, |)`, e.g. `@F+++++|` (which simply adds 5). To call a function, use a caret (`^`) and then the ASCII character used to name the function, e.g. `^F` (which calls the previously defined function `F`, thereby adding 5).
